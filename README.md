Individual research with Hasan under advisor Prof. Changick Kim (2016.05~2017.05). Source code not available (Paper under review). Our idea is that, by giving focus to the deep neural network, we can enhance its recognition accuracy. We used several state-of-art network to prove our idea (VGG-M, VGG-VD-19, Google-net, Res-net, LRCN) for well-known public dataset (ILSVRC, UCF101). Attached excel file shows change in network accuracy results after giving focus. (smaller k means stronger focus)
